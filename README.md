# ticket-to-ride
A program that plays Ticket to Ride!

Call  
`winner = ticket(numplayers)`

The program can now compete (at least a little)! It has some general algorithms to help it valuate edges and can complete goal cards with only a little bit of difficulty. It's not "smart," meaning that the possible strategies are manually coded. There is no general strategy, abstracted from a representation of the game board, resources, and goal cards.

If turned on, the `plotgraph` function allows you to visualize the gameplay.
