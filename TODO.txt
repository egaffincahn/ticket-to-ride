**add longest road
-make plotting prettier?
-improve logging: at a minimum, make a logger with just the metadata (time, which generation)
-don't want to load map stuff every time? how much time does it use
-split output_file into the weights and the metadata (maybe cohort and everything else)
-parallel computing
-no way to play a single game b/c needs class Individual
